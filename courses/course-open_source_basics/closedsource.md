# What is closed source software? 


- Free software exists as a counterpart to proprietary or "closed source" software. 
- Closed source software is highly guarded. 
- Only the owners of the source code have the legal right to access that code. 
- Closed source code cannot be legally altered or copied, and the user pays only to use the software as it is intended—they cannot modify it for new uses nor share it with their communities.
