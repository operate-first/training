# What is an open source community?

An **open source commnunity** is a group of users and developers who work together voluntarily to develop, test, or modify open source software.

- They're semi-organized collections of contributors to a given software project.

<br/>

- They bring together people with shared interests who can work collaboratively to build something.

<br/>

- The results of that collaboration is shared with anyone inside or outside of the community.

<br/>

- Community members come and go over time and can take on any of several roles within the community (not just software development).
