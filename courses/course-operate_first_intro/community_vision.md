# Operate First community

Red Hat sponsors an **Operate First open source project and community**.

The Operate First community welcomes those who want to:

- Take an Operate First approach with their applications
- Use community resources to practice operating first and develop operational code
- Help develop and maintain the community and its resources

The community aims to be as inclusive as possible, especially in terms of the required skills to contribute.

It's our goal that community members will:

- Consider Operate First as the upstream version of other cloud environments, taking what they learn in Operate First into downstream deployments.

- Contribute lessons learned from downstream back into the Operate First community where members can collaborate, grow, and apply knowledge to their deployments.

_In other words, it's a space to operate first if you don't already have a project that's operating first._
