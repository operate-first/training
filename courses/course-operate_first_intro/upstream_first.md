# Operating upstream first

Recall that a core [open source](https://www.operate-first.cloud/training/open_source_basics/) concept is **upstream first**:

- Apply changes to improve an open source upstream code base first.
- Allow the upstream contributors to make decisions, collaborate, and solve problems to maxmize open source benefits.
- Aggregate open source code from upstream projects into downstream products.

**Operate First aims to apply this same model to operations:**

- Place apps in the "upstream" open cloud first to fine tune operations.
- Aggregate the upstream operations model into downstream production deployments.
