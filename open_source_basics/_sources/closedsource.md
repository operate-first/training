# What is closed source software? 


- Free software exists as a counterpart to proprietary or "closed source" software.
- Closed source software is highly guarded.
- Only the owners of the source code have the legal right to access that code.
- Closed source code cannot be legally altered or copied, and the user pays only to use the software as it is intendedâ€”they cannot modify it for new uses nor share it with their communities.
