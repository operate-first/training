# The four essential freedoms

A computer program is considered *free software* when users have these four essential freedoms:

**Freedom 0:** The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.

**Freedom 1:** The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. (Requires access to the source code.)

**Freedom 2:** The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.

**Freedom 3:** The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others, giving whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. (Requires access to the source code.)

Some history:

* Around 1990, there were only three freedoms (1, 2, and 3).
* Freedom 0 was added later:
  * Open source advocates realized a need to mention running the program freely for any purpose.
  * This seemed more basic than the other freedoms, so it was added before them as "freedom 0."
