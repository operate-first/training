## Misconception 1: Giving away your time

<br/>

**Misconception:** *Working for open source is like giving away your time for free.*

It's true that open source contributors may not get paid for the time they put into an open source project or community. However, contributors experience other benefits like:

* Professional and social networking
* Gaining skills and experience that can lead to career advancement
* A personal sense of fulfillment
