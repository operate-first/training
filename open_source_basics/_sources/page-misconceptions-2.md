## Misconception 2: Project owners just merge

<br/>

**Misconception:** *Open source project owners just merge code without broader considerations about the code quality or the direction of the project over time.*

Merging code (adding new code to an existing project) is certainly part of contributing to open source software development. However, diligent project owners don't just merge any code into a project's code base. Each project defines the responsibilities of contributors, including:

- Reviewing pull requests
- Addressing issues raised by users
- Writing feature proposals
- Documenting their new or modified code

Look for a project's notes on how it handles code contributions.
