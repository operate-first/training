## Misconception 3: Companies don't like open source

<br/>

**Misconception:** *Commerical companies don't like open source.*

This is absolutely not true.

In fact, some companies are built around open-source, and others rely on applications and services from open source projects. They may build new functions into the code and redistribute it as freely accessible products.

If they fully participate in supporting open source, they'll also contribute their time and work to upstream communities.

For revenue, these companies rely on some other service (e.g. product support) or product (e.g. a proprietary management console). By being open with a sense of transparency, a company fosters consumer trust in their products and services.
