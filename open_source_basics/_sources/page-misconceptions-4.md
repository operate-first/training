## Misconception 4: It's a free-for-all

<br/>

**Misconception:** *It's open source, so I can do whatever I want with it.*

While open source does support the [free software](freesoftware.md) concept, **it also conforms to a license**.

We explained this earlier in [Open source licenses](open_source_licenses.md).

Corporate legal teams may vary, but they generally accept these standard open source licenses as legal agreements similar to licenses for proprietary software.
