# Open goes beyond software

The [values](values.md) of the open source software movement have inspired other types of social groups and commerical industry.

***Open*** can now translate to any kind of approach that includes:

* Transparency for everyone interested or involved

* A framework for people to get involved and contribute their own ideas

* Protocols that support equal consideration for all contributors and ideas so that the best ideas rise to the top

* Mutual trust that everyone in the group has positive intentions and a desire for the group to succeed

* Leaders that serve and support the group from within rather than staying outside and directing the group on what to do

* A mindset that what we can produce together is better than anything we could produce on our own
