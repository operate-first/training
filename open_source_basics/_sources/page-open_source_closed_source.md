# Open source vs. closed source

Software that is **open source**:

* Has source code that is legally available to end users without any additional cost.

* Allows users to make any changes to the software that they want.

* Includes the conditions to follow for repurposing and redistributing the source code so that it remains open source.

This is very different from **closed source** software, which is:

* Highly guarded and only legally accessible to a retricted set of users.

* Only available for end users, not for modification or redistribution.

<br/>

The **open source** concept started as a classification of software based on its license, which we'll cover next.
