# Open source licenses

Each open source project adopts an **open source license** that describes the conditions for using and redistributing the code.

Examples of popular open source licenses:
* GNU General Public License (GPL)
* Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL)
* Apache License 2.0

The [Open Source Initiative (OSI)](opensource.org) is an organization that promotes the benefit and adoption of open source software, and it maintains a list of open source licenses it approves:

**[Open Source Initiative: Licenses & Standards](https://opensource.org/licenses)**

**IMPORTANT:** To ensure you follow the project's license, look for these files within the code:

- **LICENSE.TXT** - This file contains the license information itself. The license typically includes a condition that this file (unmodified) follows the code on redistribution.

- **README** - README files often provide guidelines that can help you follow the open source license.
