# Upstream first development

Changes in open source software can flow in two directions, upstream and downstream. Here's how we use those terms:

- **Upstream** refers to the original open source project where a community of users and developers maintain the original code.

- **Downstream** refers to any projects, products, or services that are derived from that original open source project.

**Upstream first** is an approach to developing software that starts by contributing changes to the upstream code first. Here's how it works:

- Developers need to make permanent improvements or fixes in their downstream code over time.

- They make those changes starting in the original open source project (upstream).

- After the open source project accepts those changes, the developers then pull that updated code into their downstream code.

- Other downstream code based on the same upstream can benefit from that same contribution.

**NOTE:** When there's an urgent need for a fix, developers may develop a patch directly on the downstream code, but that's considered temporary.
