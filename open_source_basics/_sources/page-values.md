# Open source values

The open source software movement is driven by these values:

**Peer review:** An active community of developers can contribute ideas that can improve the software over time and, potentially, faster than in small, closed development teams.

**Transparency:** Users can check and track the kinds of changes are happening without having to rely on vendor promises.

**Reliability:** Open standards and peer review ensure that open source code is tested appropriately and often, and multiple authors can check and ensure quality.

**Flexibility:** Users aren't locked into using the code in any one specific way. They can use it to address problems that are unique to them, and they can work with the community to develop and peer review new solutions.

**Lower cost:** Open source licenses allow the core code itself to be free, and those distributing custom solutions based on that code can charge based on other factors (e.g. planning and deployment services, support, hosting, etc.).

**No vendor lock-in:** Users can take that source code anywhere and use it for anything at any time, and they can integrate it with solutions from any vendor they choose.

**Open collaboration:** Open source communities provide help, resources, and perspectives that reach one interest group or one company.
