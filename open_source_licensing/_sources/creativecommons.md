# Creative Commons


<br/>

- The licenses discussed in this course only apply to software. Open source is a concept applies to many other areas. For works other than software there is the Creative Commons.


- Creative Commons was founded in 2001 by Professor Lawrence Lessig of the Harvard Law School. The goal of the Creative Commons is to make creative works available through licensing in the same way open source software is available. 


- Where open source software licenses have filled that need for software Creative Commons has filled the need for non-software works.


- Now while you won't find the Creative Commons license listed on opensource.org the opensource.org website itself is licensed under the Creative Commons.


- If the free software foundation were to ever make the text of the GNU licenses, that's the GPL, the LGPL, and the AGPL respectively, to make the text of the licenses open a Creative Commons license would be the appropriate vehicle for that effort.
