# What is “distribution"?

<br/>

- In simple terms, distribution refers to transferring a copy of a copyrighted work (such as software) from one legal person to another.


- The concept of distribution matters because the requirements of open source licenses are triggered only when software is distributed.


- Thus, a person who does not distribute software cannot violate an open source license’s terms.



- And because “legal person” includes a corporation, there is no distribution—and therefore no risk of violating a license’s terms—if software is merely transferred between employees of the same company.
