# Mass Open Cloud (MOC)

*Another example of operating first...*

The **[Mass Open Cloud (MOC)](https://massopen.cloud/)** is a production public cloud developed on the [OCX](ocx.md) model.

- Hosted at Boston University and housed at the Hariri Institute for Computing.

<br/>

- A collaborative effort between higher education, government, non-profit entities, and industry.

<br/>

**Primary goals:**

- To create an inexpensive and efficient at-scale production cloud utility (based on the OCX model) suitable for sharing and analyzing massive data sets and supporting a broad set of applications.
- To create a testbed for researching and prototyping of cloud technology, enabling a broad community of researchers, open source developers and companies to develop new cloud computing technologies.

**These goals are interdependent.** To drive research, foster new technologies, and enable full exploration of the OCX model, a production cloud must have a customer base and a revenue stream that covers its costs.
