# Operate First concept

**[Operate First](https://www.operate-first.cloud/)** is concept to incorporate operational experience into software projects.

- "Operate" software in a production-grade environment that brings users, developers and operators closer together.

<br/>

- Invite open source developers to bring their projects to a production cloud during development where they can interact with a cloud provider's operators and gain valuable feedback on the operational considerations of their project.

<br/>

- Apply a methodology that's similar to [open source](https://www.operate-first.cloud/training/course-open_source_basics), but without functioning as code, a license, hardware, or a cloud.

<br/>

- Use the same community-building process of open source projects, but extended to ops procedures and data.
