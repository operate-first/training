# Operate First rationale

- Open source removed access to software as a limiting factor for businesses and individuals... *and we believe that was a good thing!*

- That access has led to the ever-growing complexity of software stacks... *and that presents an operational capacity challenge.*

- This has led to cloud computing as the dominant operational paradigm of IT... *and with that comes the challenge of operating efficiently and effectively*.

- Proprietary services based on open source are trying to meet this challenge, but they're doing so in a way that undermines the open source model itself.

**To meet the challenge of operating complex software stacks in a cloud, continue the open source model, and best meet users' needs, application developers *must***:

* Develop a practical understanding of what it means to put their software into operations.
* Integrate operational logic into the software itself.
