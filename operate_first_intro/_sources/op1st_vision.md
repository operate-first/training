# Operate First vision

***Integrating the code and the cloud...***

- Making software more accessible through open source is no longer sufficient without the ability to operate that software in production.

- In the age of cloud computing, operational excellence needs to be encapsulated *with* the software products and services.

- An application team's focus must shift from software availability to operating services.

- To ensure that software projects address operational considerations, we need a new method for developers to experience the operation of their projects in a real cloud setting... *that's the Operate First mindset.*

***Operate your code in a cloud first, while still in development, then release.***
