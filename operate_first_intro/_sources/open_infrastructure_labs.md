# Open Infrastructure Labs

Operate First looks to **[Open Infrastructure Labs (OpenInfra Labs)](https://openinfralabs.org/)** as an open source upstream.

- Cloud providers and operators can work together with project developers to advance the state of the art for managing open source clouds.
- Cloud operations are brought into the open.
- Community members keep open source relevant by providing an alternative to proprietary cloud providers.
- Provides a common and collaborative space to:
  - Host multiple independent open source projects that are all related to cloud operations.
  - Develop and refine AIOps tools to assist with cloud operations.
  - Deploy open source software in an open source production cloud.

OpenInfra Labs operates under the aegis of the [OpenInfra Foundation](https://openinfra.dev/).
