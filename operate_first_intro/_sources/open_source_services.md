# Open Source Services

**[Open Source Services](http://opensource-services.gitlab.io/)** is an initiative to bring true open source principles to software as a service (SaaS).

Rationale:

- The challenge of creating an open source SaaS offering is in opening it up to contributions by users (converting users to contributors).

- Meeting this challenges requires another perspective on the deployment model:   
  - Services can be shared by users and versions.
  - The entry barrier to make changes is lower.

***This is not contradictory to the Operate First concept, but an extension to it.***

Services that incubate in the [Operate First Cloud](op1st_cloud_env.md) can ultimately become either:
- An upstream for an enterprise service
- The host of the community shard of a single service
