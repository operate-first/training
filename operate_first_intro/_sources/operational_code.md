# Operational code

All code and artifacts created in the [Operate First Cloud](op1st_cloud_env.md) *or* by other clouds that operate first should find an ultimate home in projects that are operated first.

- The intent is that project-specific operational code created as a result of a project operating first is brought back into that project.***
- When code is not project-specific, Operate First encourages giving it a home somewhere that other open source projects can benefit.

That's where places like the **[Operate First GitHub space](https://github.com/operate-first)** comes in, managed by the [Operate First community](community_vision.md).

This space serves as a home to:

- Operational code that doesn't yet fit in other projects that are operated first

- Configuration and blueprints for setting up the cloud and services

- Operational data available for public inspection
